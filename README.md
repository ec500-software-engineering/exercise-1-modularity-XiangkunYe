# exercise-1-modularity-XiangkunYe

## Introduction
Here's the integration of modules of my group. The storage.py is
written by me, and the alert_system.py is also basically written
by me since the original one cannot work. Others are copied from my
teammates' repo, details are provided in the first comment inside
those files.

## Usage
First, please make sure you have all module required in the same directory
and MongoDB is running.

Then you could just run main.py, every module is used
inside it, or just import any module you want into your
own file and use as API.
