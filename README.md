# exercise-1-modularity-XiangkunYe

## Introduction
Here's the integration of modules of my group. The storage.py is
written by me, and the alert_system.py is also basically written
by me since the original one cannot work. Others are copied from my
teammates' repo, details are provided in the first comment inside
those files.

## Usage
First, please make sure you have all files in the same directory and mongodb is running.
Also, read requirements.txt please.

For normal use, please run **main.py**, every module is used
inside it. If you want to try multithread, please run **multithread_main.py**.
