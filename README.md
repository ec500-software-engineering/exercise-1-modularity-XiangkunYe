# exercise-1-modularity-XiangkunYe

## Introduction
Here's the integration of modules of my group. The storage.py is
written by me, and the alert_system.py is also basically written
by me since the original one cannot work. Others are copied from my
teammates' repo, details are provided in the first comment inside
those files.

## Usage
First, please make sure you have all files in the same directory and mongodb is running.
Also, read requirements.txt please.

For normal use, please run **main.py**, every module is used
inside it. If you want to try multithread, please run **multithread_main.py**.

## System diagram

## Pros and Cons
The first pro is out diagram and structure is quite simple
The second pro is codes writen by me (storage and alert) are very clear and elegant

Maybe there's a con that we don't have AI module.
